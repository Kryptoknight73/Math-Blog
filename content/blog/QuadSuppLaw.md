We recall the law of quadratic reciprocity over $\mathbb{Q}$.

> <span class = "both">Quadratic Reciprocity:</span> For any pair of odd positive rational primes $p$ and $q$:
>  - <span class = "highlight">First Supplementary Law:</span> $\left(\tfrac{-1}{p}\right) = (-1)^{(p-1)/2}$
>  - <span class = "highlight">Second Supplementary Law:</span> $\left(\tfrac{2}{p}\right) = (-1)^{(p^2-1)/8}$
>  - <span class = "highlight">Reciprocity Law:</span> $\left(\tfrac{p}{q}\right) = \left(\tfrac{q^\*}{p}\right)$

> where $q^* = \pm q$ is congruent to $1 \bmod 4$, i.e. $q^* = (-1)^{(q-1)/2}q$.

The goal of this article will be to understand the mysterious quantity $\tfrac{p^2-1}{8}$ which shows up in the second supplementary law. We begin by understanding the first law of quadratic reciprocity:
