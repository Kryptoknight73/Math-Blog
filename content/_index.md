Welcome to my website! My name is **<span class="highlight">Haran Mouli</span>**. I am currently a senior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I major in mathematics. My interests include algebraic number theory and combinatorics. I am an active user on [Math Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/users/438557/haran).

I have been a part of the **<span class="highlight">PROMYS</span>** program for several years, both in [Boston](https://promys.org/) and [India](https://promys-india.org/). If you are a high school student or an undergraduate and passionate about mathematics, I cannot recommend PROMYS enough! It's a wonderful opportunity to learn and experience a lot of math, both as a student and a counselor. The program is filled with bright individuals and is a great place to make friends. The community is inclusive and vibrant; I would even go so far as to call it my second home.

You can reach out to me at hmouli[at]wisc[dot]edu.
