I have been a part of the PROMYS program for several years, both in Boston and India. If you are a high school student or an undergraduate and passionate about mathematics, I cannot recommend PROMYS enough! It&#39;s a wonderful opportunity to learn and experience a lot of math, both as a student and a counselor. The program is filled with bright individuals and is a great place to make friends. The community is inclusive and vibrant; I would even go so far as to call it my second home.">
